# GameJame2
So this is game created on game jam
you can move with WASD or arrows collect balls(coins) to get points. the farther you go you get more points(the game will be faster also)
crushing into things slows you down also you lose health
the source code is free to use. you can modify it.
The github release is outdated we moved with publishing to icht.io
